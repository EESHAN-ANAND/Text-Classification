# Text-Classification
Identifying several message in the form of text, whether they belong to ham or spam category

The technique for the detection of spam category done using the Naive Bayes Classifier which is basically used for the spam detection

Also this repository has the implementaion of [naive bayes](https://github.com/EESHAN-ANAND/Text-Classification/blob/main/this%20has%20everything/full%20code%20implementation%20of%20naive%20bayes.ipynb) from scratch which involve **extracting the data from the dataset** and forming a **dictionary** through it and exploiting the dictionary efficiently, so that the naive bayes classifier can work.

Not only the repository has the code for the naive bayes algorithm but also has the implementaion of the [NLP problem](https://github.com/EESHAN-ANAND/Text-Classification/blob/main/this%20has%20everything/movie_review%20nlp%20problem.ipynb) which is solved using the nltk library present in the python. The nlp problem consist of the movie review.
